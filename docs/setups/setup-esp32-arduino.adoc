= Setup Arduino IDE for ESP32

This is very similar to link:/docs/setups/setup-esp8266-arduino.adoc[ESP8266 setup].

### Procedure

- Import ESP32 Board into Arduino IDE by adding URL into Settings:
  
  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

- Load the Libraries for ESP32 from panel Board Manager.

- Load sample _hello_ app into NodeMCU-32S

In Arduino IDE, select proper board, example:
- Tools/Cards/NodeMCU 32S board
- <correct USB device>

Create sketch such as the link:/sketches/esp8266-led/esp8266-led.ino[ESP8266 LED]

```js
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 2 as an output.
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}


// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
```

LED should blink as shown below:
