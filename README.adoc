This repository lists information to help hooking up sensors to arduino.

Sorry if references are ommited.
Resources come from external sites, sometimes with more details. 

Here is list things:

= Low-power

== Info

On Deek-Robot board:

* Cut the power led
* !!! Do not cut the regulator !!! On deek-robot board, need to unsolder the regulator Vout instead

== Measures

Below are measures for:
- cheap e-Bay arduino 3.3v clone (deek-robot)
- radio RFM69 wired
- using Jeelab libs. Enhanced sleep.
- various sensors
