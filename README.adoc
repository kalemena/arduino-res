:toc:

Internet Of Things starts in general with sensors and micro-controllers.

This repository lists information to help setting up and hooking up Atmega, ESP8266 or ESP32.

Sorry if references are ommited.
Resources come from external sites, sometimes with more details. 

== Board Layouts

There are tons of boards, and few layout can be found link:/docs/pinouts/pinouts.adoc[here]

== Setups

For all flavors of Atmega, just download Arduino IDE.

For ESP specifics:

* link:/docs/setups/setup-esp8266-arduino.adoc[Setup ESP 8266 Arduino IDE]
* link:/docs/setups/setup-esp32-arduino.adoc[Setup ESP 32 Arduino IDE]

== Using sensors

Here is list things: 

* link:radio.adoc[Radio RFM12]
* link:sensors-temp.adoc[Sensors Temperature]
* link:sensors-light.adoc[Sensors Light]
* link:sensors-garden.adoc[Sensors gardening]
* link:sensors-switch.adoc[Sensors switch]
* link:interop-teleinfo.adoc[Interop Teleinfo]

= Low-power

== Info

On Deek-Robot board:

* Cut the power led
* !!! Do not cut the regulator !!! On deek-robot board, need to unsolder the regulator Vout instead

== Measures

Below are measures for:
- cheap e-Bay arduino 3.3v clone (deek-robot)
- radio RFM69 wired
- using Jeelab libs. Enhanced sleep.
- various sensors
