:toc:

Internet Of Things starts in general with sensors and micro-controllers.

This repository lists information to help setting up and hooking up Atmega (Arduino, Arduino Nano, Arduino Pro Mini), ESP8266 or ESP32.

Sorry if references are ommited.
Resources are also gathered from external sites, sometimes with more details. 

== Board Layouts

There are tons of boards, and few layout can be found link:/docs/pinouts/pinouts.adoc[here]

== Docker image

The docker image link:https://hub.docker.com/r/kalemena/arduino[kalemena/arduino] contains pre-installed Arduino IDE.

The image is setup with many libraries I use, plus some boards for Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32.

== Setups

For all flavors of Atmega, just download Arduino IDE.

For ESP specifics:

* link:/docs/setups/setup-esp32-arduino.adoc[Setup ESP 32 Arduino IDE]
* link:/docs/low-power/readme.adoc[Low-power tips]
