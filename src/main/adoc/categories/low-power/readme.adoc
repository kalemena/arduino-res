== Info

On Deek-Robot board:

* Cut the power led
* !!! Do not cut the regulator !!! On deek-robot board, need to unsolder the regulator Vout instead

== Measures

Below are measures for:

* cheap e-Bay arduino 3.3v clone (deek-robot)
* radio RFM69 wired
* using Jeelab libs. Enhanced sleep.
* various sensors
