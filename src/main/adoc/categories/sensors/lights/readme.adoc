== LDR

image:Arduino-RF-sensor-LDR_bb.png[Wiring LDR]

* 60k < resistor < 400k (the higher the less power consumption, but less precise too)
* then callibrate to have an output between 0 and 256

[source,js]
----
int LDR_Pin = A0; //analog pin 0

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  int32_t LDRReading = analogRead(LDR_Pin);

  int32_t LDRfinal = map(LDRReading, 200, 1024, 0, 100);
  Serial.println(LDRfinal);
  delay(250); 
}

== TSL2561

This is standard i2c wiring.

* For arduino: SCL=A5 and SDA=A4
* For ESP12: SCL=D1 and SDA=D2
