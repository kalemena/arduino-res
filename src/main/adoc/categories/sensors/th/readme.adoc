OneWire and Dallas libraries required to read DS18B20 sensor.

This is possible to wire several sensors together (not explained here).

Sketches to try this in example from libraries to install:

[NOTE]
====
For some reasons, the jeelib driver library didn't work using above wiring.

Usage of Jeelib as driver.


== BMP85

Temperature and pressure sensor.

[TODO]


== HTU21D

Temperature and humidity sensor.

This is standard i2c wiring.
